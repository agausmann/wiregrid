# FlipFlop

A circuit simulator with two components, Flip and Flop.

Inspired by:

- [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) by Mojang Studios, for the grid-based
  wiring mechanics in redstone.

- [TUNG](https://jimmycushnie.itch.io/tung) and [Logic
  World](https://logicworld.net) by Mouse Hat Games, for the art style.

- [NandGame](https://www.nandgame.com) by Olav Junker Kj√¶r, for the idea of
  building up from something simple.
